# markdown-toolbar

Brackets extension that adds Markdown editing support via a toolbar.

## Status

This repository is in a pre-publication state; it is only minimally usable. The
toolbar displays and line-based items work (headings and lists).

## Preferences

At the moment, there is a single preference. To make the toolbar display by default
when Brackets starts, set:

```json
{
    ...
    "markdownbar.showOnStartup": true
}
```
